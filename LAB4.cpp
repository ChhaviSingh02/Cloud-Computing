// Question: Developing a Simple Client-Server Model using TCP Sockets in C++ on a Virtual Machine.
// Lab Task Description:
// You are required to set up a virtual machine (VM) with a Linux operating system and install necessary tools like GCC for C++ programming. Inside this VM, you will develop a TCP-based client-server model, where:
// * The server will listen for incoming client connections, accept a connection, receive a message, and send a response.
// * The client will connect to the server, send a message, and receive the serverâ€™s response.
// You will then compile, execute, and test the client-server model on the virtual machine.
